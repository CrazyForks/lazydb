# Redis Browser

## Loading modes

The browser initially loads Redis keys progressively. `SCAN COUNT` is only a
server hint; an empty response with a non-zero cursor is not complete. Results
are de-duplicated by raw key bytes.

Small keyspaces remain in memory. Large keyspaces may use a temporary SQLite
index so that key pages and prefix tree pages stay bounded. The index is local,
temporary, and is removed when its owner closes.

## Search and paging

Local find searches keys already received by the current browser. Redis MATCH
patterns control a new server-side scan and start a new scan generation.

Value previews are typed and bounded. Strings use byte ranges; Hashes and Sets
use cursors; Lists and Sorted Sets use ranges. A page can be partial and can
have a next position. The browser preserves raw bytes and only escapes them at
display time.

## Value preview formats

The selected Redis key displays its complete path, Redis type, Redis memory
usage when `MEMORY USAGE` is available, and TTL. Size labels use binary units
(`B`, `KB`, `MB`, and `GB`); the loaded page byte count is not presented as
the size of the complete key. TTL labels use compact units such as `55m30s`,
`850ms`, `∞`, `Missing`, or `—`.

The value area uses the same read-only Vim editor session as other LazyDB text
views, including normal-mode navigation, search, selection, mouse selection,
and editor scrollbars. `h` and `l` therefore move the Vim cursor when Preview
is focused; pane focus uses the normal pane-focus commands.

The format label can be clicked or opened from Preview with `Space f`. RAW, JSON, YAML, Table
projection, and Hex are supported views. JSON and YAML are formatted from
validated input; invalid structured input falls back to the raw view. Java,
PHP, Pickle, and schema-less Protobuf decoders are available in the
value-preview library and preserve explicit invalid/incomplete statuses.

Automatic selection validates JSON and strong serialization signatures before
selection, uses RAW for normal UTF-8, Hex for unknown binary, and Table for
Redis collections. The preview is read-only: decoded JSON/YAML is a display
projection and is not automatically encoded back to original serialized bytes.

Redis scans and value pages are not snapshots. A key may disappear or change
type between metadata and value reads. Old responses are discarded after a
database switch, refresh, tab close, or connection generation change.

## Navigation and panes

Opening a Redis database from Explorer focuses the Keys pane. As soon as the
first non-empty scan batch is available, the first top-level tree node is
selected automatically. Later scan batches preserve the current selection.

Redis tabs are labeled `Redis @connection-name`; the name belongs to the tab's
connection profile rather than to the currently active connection.

Press `?` or `F1` to open contextual help. The help panel shows only shortcuts
that apply to the focused Redis area; its heading distinguishes Redis Keys,
text Value, Table Value, and key search states. In text Value browse mode, `?`
opens help; while a search or key-filter input is active, `?` remains text input.
Use `j`/`k` to move through Keys, `o` or `Enter` to expand/collapse a folder,
and `h`/`Left` to collapse or move to the parent, or `l`/`Right` to expand or
enter the first child. In Keys, `d` deletes the selected complete key and `y`
copies its complete name; folders cannot be deleted or copied. `/` filters all
keys already loaded for this database, including keys inside collapsed folders;
Enter confirms the filter and Esc restores the previous selection. The filter
does not start a new SCAN and is explicitly limited to the loaded client-side
snapshot. In Preview, the read-only Vim buffer supports `hjkl`, `w`/`b`/`e`,
`0`/`$`, `gg`/`G`, counts, Visual mode (`v`/`V`), `/` search, `n`/`N`,
and `yy`/Visual `y` copying. `Ctrl-d`/`Ctrl-u` move half a page and
PageUp/PageDown move a full page while keeping the text cursor visible. `Space
f` cycles format, `Space w` toggles wrapping, and `Space l` loads the next
value page. Pane focus uses `Ctrl-w h/l` or Tab/BackTab; `h`/`l` in Preview
remain text motions. Keys folders use the same group icons, colors, and selection
behavior as Explorer; leaf keys use a key icon.

Deleting a folder first scans the database independently, deduplicates matching
raw-byte keys, and shows the discovered count before confirmation. Confirmation
deletes only that frozen list; keys created later are not included in the same
operation. Large deletes run in bounded batches and report deleted and already
missing keys separately. A cancelled operation does not roll back batches that
already completed.

Keys and Preview maintain independent vertical scroll positions. Scrollbars
appear only when the loaded content overflows the pane; scrolling a Preview
does not change the selected key or issue a new Redis request.

## Limits

The `[redis]` section in `settings.toml` controls scan hints, value page sizes,
memory/index thresholds, preview debounce, metadata cache capacity, and disk
limits. Limits constrain client retention and display; Redis COUNT does not
guarantee a response element count.
